1.-rs->Used to remove spaces from the given files.

2.-rn->Used to remove next line from the given files.

3.-rsc->Used to remove all the special characters from the file.It only keeps the alphabets lowercase as well as the uppercase.

4.-remsc->Used to remove a particular part of given text from the files.We give a particular part of text to it after using the dot(.) operator identifier.

5.-w->Used to write contents of one file to another file.

6.-a->Used to append the contents of one file to another file.

7.-s->add line numbers in sequence to the given files.
